# install-dev-tools
A script to install the essential dev tools for Linux from source.

These dev tools include the following:

M4
Bison
bash
libtool
libgmp
autoconf
libatomic_ops
bdw-gc
guile
wget
autogen
libnettle
gnutls
coreutils
tar
gzip
bz2
xz
lzip
make
gcc

and all other miscellaneous dependencies.

This script assumes the PATH folder includudes ~/.local
It also assumes the dev tools are already installed. 

I made this script to learn how the GNU build system was set up.

This script is not yet finished and must be considered unsatble.
